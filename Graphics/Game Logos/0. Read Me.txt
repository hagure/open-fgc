# Sup y’all. 

Here you’ll find logos for many games run at FGC events. I’ve tried to add the largest & highest quality logos with transparent backgrounds that I could find. In the “Game Logos Unused” folder, you’ll find logos that are of lower quality, or are for older versions of games that aren’t used for tournaments (e.g. UNIEL & Xrd Sign).

If you have any logos that are missing, or that have a higher quality version available, feel free to contact me on [twitter (@hagure)](https://twitter.com/hagure) with a direct link[1] to the file, and I’ll add it here. 

# Needed Icons:
Here’s an incomplete list of icons that need to be added.

- Skullgirls 2nd Encore (better version)
- Melty Blood Actress Again Current Code (bigger version)
- Ehrgeiz
- Vampire Hunter
- Darkstalkers 1
- Capcom Fighting Jam
- Tekken Series
- MK Series
- Tobal #2

# Disclaimer
Of course, I claim no ownership to these logos, all rights to their respective owners, etc.



Hope this resource helps y’all!
